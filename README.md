## Tick Data
- Counties classified as “present” are those where Borrelia burgdorferi s.s. or Borrelia mayonii have been identified in one or more host-seeking Ixodes scapularis or Ixodes pacificus ticks, using species-specific molecular methods.
- Counties classified as “no records” should not be interpreted as the pathogen being absent. No records could be a result of a lack of sampling efforts, tick collections, pathogen testing in collected ticks, or a lack of reporting or publishing the results of sampling efforts.
