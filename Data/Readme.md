Lyme Background info:

Chronic Lyme disease, which ILADS defines as an ongoing infection with any of the pathogenic bacteria in the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato group, is poorly understood and often mischaracterized. Although the infection was often described as "chronic" early in the history of Lyme disease, that terminology was abandoned by the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) and many IDSA-affiliated researchers and clinicians in the late 1990s. The rationale for that switch is unclear, as the bacteria's ability to cause a chronic and sometimes post-antibiotic persistent infection was already well documented in the scientific literature. The CDC generally maintains that Lyme disease is an acute infection and it does not readily acknowledge that the infection can persist following antibiotic treatment. Instead, the CDC recognizes other potential causes for ongoing symptoms. The CDC endorses the use of the term “Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome”(PTLDS) when symptoms persist for more than six months following antibiotic.
